# ðŸ”— Cross-Page AI Bridge

**Break the walls between browser tabs.**

Transform any AI chat interface into a remote control for any web page across the internet. This bookmarklet duo creates an invisible bridge that lets your ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant directly manipulate and interact with websites in other tabsâ€”bypassing CORS, CSP, and COEP restrictions that normally keep pages isolated.

## âœ¨ The Magic

- **Dual Bookmarklets**: One for your AI chat, one for target pages
- **Invisible Intermediary**: A relay website that orchestrates cross-origin communication
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any AI chat interface and any target website
- **Security-First**: Uses postMessage tunneling to respect browser security boundaries

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Inject the **Control** bookmarklet into your AI chat page
2. Inject the **Target** bookmarklet into any website you want to control
3. The intermediary site creates a secure communication channel
4. Watch your AI assistant reach across the digital divide to interact with remote pages

*When browser security becomes a feature, not a limitation.*
